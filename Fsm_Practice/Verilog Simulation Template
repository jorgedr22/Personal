VERILOG SIMIULATION TEMPLATE

file_name is the name of the verilog code
file_name_tb is the testbench 
file_name_tb.vcd is the SIMIULATION

`include "file_name.v"

$dumpfile("file_name_tb.vcd");
$dumpvars(0,file_name_tb);


To compile:
iverilog -o file_name_tb.vvp file_name_tb.v

To run:
vvp file_name_tb.vvp

View the timing diagram using GTKWAVE:

1.open -a gtkwave

2.File -> New Tab

3.Select the .vcd file which is created when we ran the testbench code.

4.Select all the wires whose signals you want to analyse graphically 
  and then click on append
